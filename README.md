# rCPU
A minimal webserver for remote CPU monitoring.  Everything is embedded in the executable, so you just need to run the program.  I'm planning to run it on my Raspberry Pi 2 to monitor the use of each core.  It should run on other Linux machines too.

NOTE: the code to check the core temperature is designed for the Raspberry Pi, it might not work on other machines...
